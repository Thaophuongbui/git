                    <center>
                        <p>From a cultural standpoint, coffeehouses largely serve as centers 
                        of social interaction: the coffeehouse provides patrons with a place
                        to congregate, talk, read, write, entertain one another, or pass the time,
                        whether individually or in small groups.
                        </p>
                    </center>

                    <center><h3>THE EXPERIENCE</h3></center>
                    <center>
                        <p>The coffee is brewed by first roasting the green coffee beans over 
                        hot coals in a brazier. Once the beans are roasted each 
                        participant is given an opportunity to sample the aromatic 
                        smoke by wafting it towards them. This is followed by 
                        the grinding.
                        </p>
